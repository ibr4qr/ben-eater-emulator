# Ben Eater Machine
Simple Toolchain around the Simple As Possible Ben Eater computer architecure, including a VM ( emulator ), assembler, compiler, decompiler.

This Project is for learning purpose, in fact we are trying to build a toolchain around the famous SAP (Simple-As-Possible) ben eater computer architecture.

## Architecture of Physical Machine

## Overview


The Design is pretty simple, and will include 3 modules. 

- Ben Eater Computer Emulator
- Assembler
- Compiler
- Decompiler


### Ben Eater Computer Emualtor
This module will produce a ( VM ) Virtual Machine, which is actually an emualtor of the ben Eater computer, so will execute the instruction set of the physical device.

### Assembler
This module will produce a system software that translates a higher level human readable code into machine code.


### Compiler
This module will produce a system software that will compile a higher level human readable code, more structured, into assembly language.

### Decompiler
This module will produce a system software that will reverse an assembly file into an higher level language. 




## Ben Eater Computer Emualtor Design

### Registers

Let's start with registers, the architecture features three registers, named, Register A, Register B, Register IR 

So in this simple design we have two general purposes registers.

- Register A 
- Register B

And we have a special purpose register, specifically the IR register will hold the current instruction that's being executed.

### RAM ( Random Access Memory )

The RAM, stores the program currently the computer is executing and the data.
The computer uses 4-bit addresses which means it will only have 16 bytes of RAM, limiting the size and complexity of programs it can run. This is by far its biggest limitation.

### Program Counter

The program counter (PC) counts in binary to keep track of which instruction the computer is currently executing


### Arithmetic logic unit

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) part of a CPU is usually capable of performing various arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations on binary numbers. In our simple breadboard CPU, the ALU is just able to add and subtract. Itâ€™s connected to the A and B registers and outputs either the sum of A+B or the difference of A-B.

## Instruction Set
Instructions are 8 bit long, and include.
- NOP   => 0x00
- LDA   => 0b0001 @ address[3:0]
- ADD   => 0b0010 @ address[3:0]
- SUB   => 0b0011 @ address[3:0]
- STA   => 0b0100 @ address[3:0]
- OUT   => 0b0000
- JMP   => 0b0110 @ address[3:0]
- LDI   => 0b0111 @ value[3:0]
- JC    => 0b1000 @ address[3:0]
- JNC   => 0b1001 @ address[3:0]
- HALT  => 0b1111 @ 0b0000
