# Ben Eater Machine

Simple Toolchain around the Simple As Possible Ben Eater computer architecure, including a VM ( emulator ), assembler, compiler, decompiler.

This Project is for learning purposes, we are trying to build a toolchain around the famous SAP (Simple-As-Possible) ben eater computer architecture.

## Architecture of the Physical Machine

[Architecture of physical machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple-As-Possible_computer#/media/File:Ben_Eater_SAP_High_Level_Overview.jpg)

## Overview

The Design is pretty simple, and will include 4 modules.

- Ben Eater Computer Emulator
- Assembler
- Compiler
- Decompiler

### Ben Eater Computer Emualtor

This module will produce a ( VM ) Virtual Machine, which is actually an emualtor of the ben Eater computer, so will execute the instruction set of the physical device.

### Assembler

This module will produce a system software that translates a higher level human readable code into machine code.

### Compiler

This module will produce a system software that will compile a higher level human readable code, more structured, into assembly language.

### Decompiler

This module will produce a system software that will reverse an assembly file into an higher level language.

## Ben Eater Computer Emualtor Design

### Registers

Let's start with registers, the architecture features three registers, named, Register A, Register B, Register IR

So in this simple design we have two general purposes registers.

- Register A
- Register B

In this architecture we have special registers as well:

- Program Counter PC ( Holds the address of next instruction to be executed )
- Memory Address Register MI ( holds the the address of main memory )
- Instruction Register IR ( holds the current instruction that's being executed)

And we have a special purpose register, specifically the IR register will hold the current instruction that's being executed.

### RAM ( Random Access Memory )

The RAM, stores the program currently the computer is executing and the data.
The computer uses 4-bit addresses which means it will only have 16 bytes of RAM, limiting the size and complexity of programs it can run. This is by far its biggest limitation.

### Program Counter

The program counter (PC) counts in binary to keep track of which instruction the computer is currently executing

### Arithmetic logic unit

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) part of a CPU is usually capable of performing various arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations on binary numbers. In our simple breadboard CPU, the ALU is just able to add and subtract. Itâ€™s connected to the A and B registers and outputs either the sum of A+B or the difference of A-B.

## How everything works together

[The logic of the computer](https://www.bencode.net/posts/oidc/)

## Instruction Set

Instructions are 8 bit long, and include.

- NOP => 0x0
- LDA => 0x1 @ address[3:0]
- ADD => 0x2 @ address[3:0]
- SUB => 0x3 @ address[3:0]
- STA => 0x4 @ address[3:0]
- LDI => 0x5 @ value[3:0]
- JMP => 0x6 @ address[3:0]
- JC => 0x7 @ address[3:0]
- JNC => 0x8 @ address[3:0]
- OUT => 0xE
- HALT => 0xF @ 0b0000

## Modules

As said before we have 4 modules, the VM ( emulator ), the Assembler, the Compiler, and the Decompiler.

### High Level Overview

### Uml Package Diagram

### Uml Component Diagram

![UML Component Diagram](./docs/images/uml-component-diagram.png?raw=true)

We will split the into 2 groups:

- Compiling ( Assembler, Compiler, Decompiler)
- Executing ( Emulator )

## Compiling

Compiling Module will have all submodules that enable us to write code in a higher level human readable manner.

## Executing

Executing Modules is simpler, will have one submodule for now, and will execute the code that is compliant with the instruction set.

Here we have a simple UML componente diagram

## Starting with Executing

To use the vm, go to the vm crate and use the utility below
to produce a binary file, which store a binary program that implements a counter from 10 to 1.

```
printf '\x51\x4F\x5A\x0\x3F\x73' > output.bin
```

## Assembly language examples:

#### basic LDI, STA, OUT

```
LDI 12
OUT
STA 14
LDI 3
OUT
LDA 14
OUT
```

### De counter from 15 to 0

```
LDI 15
STA 15
LDI 1
STA 14
LDA 15
SUB 14
OUT
JC 4
```

### from 0 to 254, step of 2

```
LDI 10
STA 14
LDI 2
STA 15
LDI 0
ADD 15
OUT
JMP 5
```

### From 0 to 10, step 2

```
LDI 0
STA 13
LDI 2
STA 15
LDI 10
STA 14
LDA 13
ADD 15
OUT
STA 13
LDA 14
SUB 13
JC 6
```

### Fibonacci series

```
LDI 1
STA 13
LDI 0
STA 14
LDA 13
STA 15
ADD 14
OUT
STA 13
LDA 15
STA 14
JMP 4
```

### Compiling from higher level language to Assembly Language

#### Lexer

#### Parser

#### Assembler Code Generator

##### Expression Grammar:

- program => declaration\* EOF;
- declaration => varDecl | statement;
- varDecl => "var" IDENTIFIER "=" expression ";";
- statement => exprStmt | printStmt;
- exprStmt => expression ";";
- printStmt => "print" expression ";"
- expression => assignment;
- assignment => (call "." )? IDENTIFIER "=" assignment | equality;
- equality => comparison ( ("!=" | "==") comparison)\*;
- comparison => term ( (">" | ">=" | "<" ) term)\*;
- term => primary ( ("-" | "+") primary )\*
- primary => NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER;

###### Examples:

```
print(10+20); var me = 100;
```

will be parsed producing this ast.

first declaration:

```
PrintDecl { argument: BinaryExpr { operator: Token { token_type: Plus, lexeme: "+" }, right: Literal { value: 20 }, left: Literal { value: 10 } } }
```

second declaration:

```
declaration: VarDecl { identifier: "me", initializer: Literal { value: 100 } }
```
